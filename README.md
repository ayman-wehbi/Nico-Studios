# Nico Studios
#### Mobile Application developed using React Native

Nico Studio is an application specifically designed for songwriters. This app is designed to help musicians write songs on their mobile devices. Ever since Apple revolutionized the iPhone and iOS, followed by Google's take on it with Android, many artists have gone from creating songs in notebooks to writing songs on their phones. The amount of artists making the switch is growing by the day. Most note applications are intended to quickly jot down notes, tasks, or a grocery list, but not to the extent that an artist desires to organize their discographies. Lyrics written months ago are lost deep into the application's hells, requiring hours to find unless a specific line is searched for; if even the artist remembers a line since they write too frequently to remember everything. This app will concentrate on providing musicians with a space to write without the distractions of a standard notes app or any shopping lists written in between song
files.

We want users to feel at ease using this app. We want a forward-going design in which the user does not have to navigate across pages to reach their desired destination. For example, if a user is on a song page and wants to see all the songs they've written for that project, they wouldn't have to go back to the main page, find the projects section, and then look for the project; instead, they'd have a button on top that takes them to the project this song belongs to. This fluidity will help the artist feel more productive and in control. They don't have to distract themselves by seeking for something for so long while production surges, but instead focus on crafting the best song possible. We want the user to be as productive as possible while using our program.

Artists are often forced to write songs on basic note apps that do not satisfy their needs in terms of appearance, organization, and functionality. We're focusing on creating a simple user interface for writing songs and recording drafts so the artist doesn't forget a melody. Nico Studio will make songwriting more convenient for the artist by maximizing productivity and reducing distractions caused by a crowded UI/UX and the necessity to transfer between apps to use different functions such as a rapid recording and a rhyming dictionary. Nico Studio is intended for songwriters, upcoming and current artists, musicians, and creatives who aspire to easily
create and store their projects.

The target demographic of this app would be songwriters, poets, and song producers. All of these people will need a pad to write down their thoughts in a manner designed for their artistic and creative thought. This is where NicoStudio comes in.

#### HomeScreen
The index screen of the app. This screen shows 5 cards. Two cards for pinning a song, one for the task list, and final two for the most recently created songs. This is paired with a navigation bar that lets users travel between the three main screens: Home, Project, and Songs, along with a Create screen that provides options to create a song or a project.

#### Projects
The projects screen contains cards of every project created in alphabetical order. Tapping on a project opens the screen to what the object contains. The way projects are structured are objects of objects, as opposed to an array of objects, as that would be ideal for a cloud-based approach eventually.

#### Song Lyrics
This is where the songs are displayed through a flat list. Songs can either be independent objects or a part of a project object. These files can also be edited and deleted as the user chooses.
